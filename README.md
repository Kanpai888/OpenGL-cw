OpenGL Coursework - Mars in Fiction
-----------------------------------

This is a copy of my 3rd year graphics project. The user controls are a little unituitive, but was required by the spec. 

### Files
- Source.cpp - Source file
- *.vert - Vertex shader files
- *.frag - Fragment shader files
- *.obj - Object files, contains vertices of objects
- *.tga - Texture files

### Compile
It will require glew and glut dlls to compile so ensure that you have them setup accordingly.
